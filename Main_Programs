1)Write a program that reads a single line of input and print the given input.
Solution:
word = str(input())
print(word)


2)Write a program to check if the last three characters in the two given strings are the same.The first and second lines of inputs are strings.

Solution:
word = input()
word1 = input()
print(word[-3:] == word1[-3:])
Input:
apple 
pimple
Output:True

3) Write a program that reads the marks M in Maths, marks P in Physics and marks C in Chemistry and checks if both the below conditions are satisfied.
M >= 35 and P >= 35 and C >= 35.
M + P >= 90 or P + C >= 90 or M + C >= 90.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing marks M in Maths.
The second line of input contains an integer representing marks P in Physics.
The third line of input contains an integer representing marks C in Chemistry.
Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if both the given conditions are satisfied, otherwise False should be printed.
Input:
50
35
40
Output:True


Solution:
m = int(input())
p = int(input())
c = int(input())
if ((m >= 35) and (p>=35) and (c>=35)):
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")

4)Write a program that reads the marks M in Maths, marks P in Physics and marks C in Chemistry and checks if any of the below conditions is satisfied.

M >= 60 and P >= 50 and C >= 45 and M + P + C >= 180.
M + P >= 120 or C + P >= 110.
Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing marks M in Maths.
The second line of input contains an integer representing marks P in Physics.
The third line of input contains an integer representing marks C in Chemistry.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if any of the given conditions is satisfied, otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given marks are M = 72, P = 65 and C = 51,

✔ M >= 60 and P >= 50 and C >= 45 and M + P + C >= 180

✔ M + P >= 120 or C + P >= 110

The output should be True as any of the given conditions is satisfied.

Sample Input 1
72
65
51
Sample Output 1
True


Solution:
m = int(input())
p = int(input())
c = int(input())
if((m>=60) and (p>=50) and (c>=45) and (m+p+c>=180)) or ((m+p>=120) or (c+p>=110)):
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")

5)Years, Weeks & Days
Given N number of days as input, write a program to convert N number of days to years (Y), weeks (W) and days (D).
Note: Take 1 year = 365 days.  
Input
The input contains single integer N.
Output
The first line of output contains an integer Y representing the number of years.
The second line of output contains an integer W representing the number of weeks.
The third line of output contains an integer D representing the number of days.
Explanation
Given  N = 1329. The value can be written as 
1329 = 3 years + 33 weeks + 3 days
So the output should be 
3 33 3

Sample Input:
1329
Sample Output:
3
33
3

Solution:
N = int(input())
year = N//365
remdays = N%365
week = remdays//7
d = remdays %  7
print(int(year))
print(int(week))
print(int(d))
